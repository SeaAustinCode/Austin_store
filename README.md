The main function of this project allows users to filter through products using various search categories such as price, number of stars, speed of delivery and through the use of a searchbar. Users can then manage their shopping cart and use PayPal, Venmo, PayLater or a credit/debit card to checkout. 

I utilized Faker API to create all of the products and their details. This drastically cut down on development time as I didn't have to create an entire database and fill it with items, pictures, prices etc and instead was able to focus on the functionality of the website. 

I used the colors of my favorite baseball team to help quickly style the website and imported a font from google to help make the website feel a little more clean.
