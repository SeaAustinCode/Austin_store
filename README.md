React, Node.js, Context/Paypal API, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS

The main function of this project allows users to filter through products using various search categories such as price, number of stars, speed of delivery and through the use of a searchbar. Users can then manage their shopping cart and use PayPal, Venmo, PayLater or a credit/debit card to checkout. 

I utilized Faker API to create all of the products and their details. This drastically cut down on development time as I didn't have to create an entire database and fill it with items, pictures, prices etc and instead was able to focus on the functionality of the website. 

I used the colors of my favorite baseball team to help quickly style the website and imported a font from google to help make the website feel a little more clean.
